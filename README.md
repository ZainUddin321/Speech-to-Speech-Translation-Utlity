# Speech-to-Speech-Translation-Utlity
This project aims to develop a speech-to-speech translation model using deep learning RNN layers to help tourists and hotel  staff communicate with each other seamlessly. In addition to developing the model, we have created a custom dataset of more  than 25,000 sentences to improve the accuracy and fluency of the model.
